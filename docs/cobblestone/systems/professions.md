## The Shape of Work

The professions and trades of **Cobblestone Legacy** are not fixed classes or scripted archetypes—they are living roles that emerge naturally from the city itself.  
The goal is to eventually represent **every occupation a real city might need**, from humble street sweepers to ambitious merchants and skilled artisans.

There are no predefined limits or class barriers.  
An NPC—or player—can pursue any trade, provided they have the skill, the temperament, and the opportunity.

## Driven by Personality and Connection

Success in Cobblestone Legacy is shaped as much by **who you are** as by **who you know**.  
Every individual has their own personality, experiences, and abilities that influence how they approach work and relationships.

- A hardworking but cautious trader may thrive in stable markets.  
- A reckless craftsman might take shortcuts that risk disaster.  
- A persuasive performer could turn reputation into opportunity.  

And, as in real life, sometimes it all comes down to **trust**.  
If a merchant believes in you, you might be offered a place in their new venture. If your reputation suffers, doors quietly close.

## A City That Runs Itself

There are no global scripts deciding which professions exist or how they function.  
The city breathes on its own, each citizen making choices that sustain or disrupt its rhythm.

Shops open and close.  
Workshops hire and fire.  
Shipments arrive—or vanish on the road.  
The success or failure of a profession depends on the same things that shape every life: opportunity, circumstance, and the choices of others.

## The Vision Ahead

The profession system is still in early development, but its long-term aim is clear:  
a world where **every role matters**, and where the economy, politics, and stories of the city are built from the ground up by the people who inhabit it.

Players and NPCs alike will find their paths through ambition, reputation, and connection—each decision weaving another thread into the fabric of a truly simulated city.
