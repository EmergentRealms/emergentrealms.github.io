Grimborough is more than a backdrop—it is a character forged from soot, ambition, and tragedy. This page outlines the opening narrative, setting tone, and visual direction for the city map.

## Opening Narrative

A grimdark introduction welcomes players into the world. The scene fades from a black screen to an industrial skyline shrouded in smoke. The narrator frames the era:

> "The year is 1847, and the city of Grimborough stands as a monument to progress... and despair. Its factories churn wealth for the fortunate few, while the downtrodden drown in its shadows."

Players witness a montage of their protagonist’s early life—loving parents, modest joy, and fragile hope—before tragedy strikes. Thieves (or worse) take everything, leaving the orphan alone in the streets. The narrator’s final challenge sets the stage:

> "And so, alone and cast into the heartless streets of Grimborough, your story begins. From these shadows, what will you become? Will you rise above the filth and chaos… or will you let it consume you?"

### Player Onboarding

## Map Art Direction

Design a hand-drawn, parchment-toned city map echoing 19th-century engravings.

### Coastal Layout
- Winding coastline with sandy beaches, jagged cliffs, and a bustling harbor.
- Offshore rocks and small islands, anchored by a lighthouse perched on a cliff.

### Districts & Landmarks
- **Slums:** Tightly packed alleys, shanties, hideouts, and subtle stash markers.
- **Market District:** Open-air stalls, a merchant guild hall, and crossroads of commerce.
- **Industrial Zone:** Factories with towering smokestacks, warehouses, and rail spurs.
- **Residential Wards:** Middle-class housing grids, noble estates, manicured gardens, and a scholar’s hall.
- **Docks:** Shipyards, cranes, taverns, and warehouses brimming with contraband.
- **Sacred & Civic Sites:** A grand church with surrounding graves, guardhouses at chokepoints, and a dilapidated orphanage.
- **Hidden Layers:** Underground sewers with visible access points, gang hideouts in abandoned factories, and stashes tucked beneath bridges.

### Paths & Surroundings
- Cobblestone main roads, labyrinthine alleys, and dirt trails to the outskirts.
- Forests, farms, and windmills beyond the city walls, plus a river feeding the harbor.
- Ships of varying sizes dot the bay; decorative touches include a compass rose, sea monsters, and trade annotations.

## Narrative & System Hooks

- **Rumors & Exploration:** Map annotations hint at secret routes, heist targets, and faction turf.
- **Faction Presence:** District labeling aligns with power blocs, foreshadowing future conflicts.
- **Player Progression:** The city evolves visually as players climb from slums to noble quarters.

This foundation ensures the city’s look, feel, and story beats support the rich systems detailed across the rest of the documentation.
