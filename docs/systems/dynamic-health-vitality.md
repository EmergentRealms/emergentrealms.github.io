Survival in Cobblestone Legacy goes beyond a simple health bar. The Dynamic Health & Vitality System simulates the body’s response to hardship, forcing players to plan every meal, rest break, and sprint through the city.

## Pillars of the System

### Comprehensive Needs Management
- Track **health, stamina, energy, hydration,** and **weight** simultaneously.
- Regeneration depends on rest quality, injuries, weather exposure, and recent activity—no instant heals.

### Weight, Body Composition & Aging
- Body fat and muscle mass evolve with caloric intake, exertion, and age.
- Starvation, overexertion, or neglect weakens performance; a balanced routine strengthens it.
- Characters age over multi-run progression, shifting metabolic needs and physical potential.

### Energy, Starvation & Hydration
- Daily caloric intake fuels your energy pool, dictating how much stamina can regenerate.
- Prolonged deficits trigger muscle loss, stat degradation, and slower recovery.
- Hydration affects coordination, reaction speed, and heat resistance—dehydration kills faster than hunger.

### Environmental Interaction
- Extreme temperatures, humidity, and encumbrance accelerate resource drain.
- Safe rest zones accelerate recovery; exposure slows or halts it.

### Tactical Load Management
- Carry weight directly impacts stamina costs, traversal speed, and stealth effectiveness.
- Preparing for a heist means balancing food, water, tools, and loot capacity.

## Gameplay Impact

| System | Player Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| **Stat Evolution** | Training increases strength/endurance, while malnutrition causes gradual decline. |
| **Weight & Muscle** | Starvation strips fat and muscle, reducing max stamina and damage output. |
| **World Interaction** | Weather, safehouses, and time of day modify recovery efficiency. |
| **Performance** | Stamina fuels traversal and combat; energy governs how fast it returns. |

## Why It Matters

- **Immersive Survival:** Physical needs feel tangible, making every resource decision meaningful.
- **Long-Term Progression:** Your body tells the story of your run—scars, exhaustion, and newfound resilience.
- **Strategic Depth:** Success comes from balancing risk, preparation, and route planning.

> *"Survive, Adapt, Overcome: Your body is your greatest asset—or your greatest weakness."*
