## Endless Story Variants

The Dynamic Quest & Goal System keeps playthroughs fresh by blending NPC-generated quests, faction missions, and player-declared ambitions.

### Intent-Driven Progression
- Players can declare personal goals such as "Become a master thief" or "Start a business."
- Each intent spawns structured sub-quests and checkpoints tailored to that aspiration.

### Personality-Aware Contracts
- NPC personalities influence which quests they offer. Suspicious nobles avoid espionage work while desperate merchants propose smuggling or shady deals.
- Success or failure reshapes the quest graph, unlocking new branches or closing doors permanently.

### World State Integration
- Faction standing, rumor accuracy, and economic shifts all inform available objectives.
- Quests can evolve mid-run based on player decisions, rival activity, or global events.

### Dependency Tracking
- System tracks quest relationships to ensure cascading consequences. Missing a deadline or betraying a faction changes future opportunities.

### Replayability
- Procedural combinations of intents, NPC personalities, and world events deliver unique narratives across 3–6 hour runs.

Whether you are manipulating city politics, running a criminal empire, or chasing ancient secrets, the quest system shapes itself around your story.
