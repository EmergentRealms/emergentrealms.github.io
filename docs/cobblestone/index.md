# Welcome to *Cobblestone Legacy*

> *“From the streets, a legacy rises.”*

Welcome to the **official design and development documentation** for **Cobblestone Legacy**, our flagship sandbox RPG.  
This site is an open window into the creative process — where concepts, systems, and design philosophies are shared as they evolve.

Everything you read here is **a living document**: designs, mechanics, and technical systems are actively in development and subject to change as the project matures.  
Expect the details to shift, experiments to appear and disappear, and ideas to grow into more refined forms over time.

Our goal is to make this space a **transparent record of progress** and a **platform for community feedback**.  
If you’re following development, testing systems, or simply curious about the inner workings of our world, we welcome your thoughts and observations.

Thank you for visiting, reading, and supporting the journey of **Cobblestone Legacy** —  
a project built with passion, iteration, and the belief that great worlds grow best in the open.


**Cobblestone Legacy** is a **rogue-lite sandbox RPG** set in a sprawling, procedurally generated city where no two nights are the same. It offers a unique blend of **survival gameplay, high-stakes heists, faction dynamics, and emergent storytelling** that ensures **every choice you make echoes through the world**. Step into a living metropolis teeming with AI-driven citizens, unpredictable events, and endless opportunities to forge your own legacy.

## A Living, Breathing City
Explore an ever-changing urban landscape built on **procedural generation**. Each district, alleyway, and skyline is freshly generated with every playthrough, packed with hidden loot, random encounters, and dynamic challenges. The city feels alive – **NPCs follow daily routines and remember your interactions**, forming opinions and relationships that can open doors or put targets on your back. From bustling markets by day to shadowy underworld hideouts by night, the environment is constantly evolving and reacting to your actions.

## Survive and Thrive
**Survival** is at the heart of Cobblestone Legacy’s gameplay. Scrounge for food, water, and medical supplies in a world where resources are limited and danger lurks around every corner. You’ll need to manage hunger and fatigue while navigating threats like roving gangs and dynamic environmental hazards. Craft tools and improvised weapons from scrap, and adapt to random events like power outages or outbreaks. Every decision – whether to confront a threat head-on or flee to fight another day – can mean life or death in the unforgiving streets.

## Master the Heist
Embrace your inner thief in a city full of score opportunities. **Heist and Stealth** gameplay lets you plan and execute daring robberies across banks, boutiques, museums, and more. Each target presents a sandbox of possibilities: pick locks, hack security systems, sneak through ventilation shafts, or bribe insiders. Thanks to **dynamic heist systems**, security measures and guard patrols respond to your tactics – no heist ever plays out the same way twice. Will you strike under cover of darkness or con your way in during daylight? The choice is yours, but beware: getting caught has consequences, and escape is never guaranteed.

## Forge Alliances or Sow Chaos
Navigate a web of **factions** vying for control of the city’s neighborhoods. From organized crime families and underground rebels to merchant guilds and law enforcement, each faction has its own goals, resources, and attitude toward you. **Every action tilts the balance of power** – help a faction and you’ll earn rewards, discounts, or even safehouses, but you might make enemies elsewhere. Play factions against each other, broker truces, or spark turf wars; the **systemic faction dynamics** ensure the city’s power landscape shifts with your choices. Your reputation precedes you, so decide carefully whom to trust (or betray). In Cobblestone Legacy, you can’t please everyone.

## Your Story, Your Legacy
There is no pre-scripted hero’s journey here – **the narrative is dynamic and emerges from your actions**. Will you rise from scrappy survivor to legendary kingpin, or dedicate yourself to toppling the corrupt elite? The game’s **emergent storytelling** adapts to how you play: new storylines and missions trigger based on your deeds, and characters react to your moral choices. Maybe you rob a bank to feed the poor, igniting a vigilante storyline; or perhaps you double-cross a gang leader, setting off a city-wide revenge saga. Every decision plants a story seed that can blossom into a unique outcome. In Cobblestone Legacy, **you write the legacy** that future runs will remember.

## Engine and Tech
Under the hood, Cobblestone Legacy is powered by the **Godot 4** game engine (leveraging the advanced Jolt physics system) with custom high-performance C++ GDExtensions and a robust SQLite backend. This tech backbone enables the simulation of a complex, **living world** – dozens of AI characters, a **dynamic economy**, and intricate physics – all running seamlessly to support your sandbox experience. For players, that means a richer, more responsive city that runs smoothly even as chaos unfolds.
