## Opening Cinematic

A black screen fades into Grimborough—an industrial city drowning in soot, gaslight, and ambition. Towers pierce the fog as smokestacks paint the sky in cinder. It’s the same world my kids and I explore in devlogs, now framed as a playable story.

> "The year is 1847, and the city of Grimborough stands as a monument to progress... and despair. Its factories churn wealth for the fortunate few, while the downtrodden drown in its shadows. The air is thick with soot, the streets echo with the cries of merchants and the clatter of boots. It is a place of opportunity for some, and survival for most."

## Childhood Memory

Inside a humble home, loving parents cradle their newborn with hope in their eyes. They dream of a life beyond smoke and ash for their child.

> "Your parents dreamed of something better for you. A life beyond the smoke and ash. For them, you were a beacon of hope in a world that had long forgotten it."

## Player Name Prompt

> "But remind me... what was your name again?"

The player enters a name; elegant script fades in, branding the memory.

## Fleeting Joy

Montage of playtime on cobblestone streets, sewing scraps with mother, listening to father's stories.

> "Those years were fleeting, but they were good. The laughter, the love—it seemed as though it might last forever."

## Tragedy Strikes

An alleyway. Two silhouettes lie still while a child kneels beside them.

> "But happiness is a fragile thing in Grimborough. The city does not allow such luxuries for long. They came for your parents—thieves, desperate men, or perhaps worse. What they took was more than money, more than life itself. They took your world."

## Into the Streets

The screen fades to black with distant sobbing and a tolling bell.

> "And so, alone and cast into the heartless streets of Grimborough, your story begins. From these shadows, what will you become? Will you rise above the filth and chaos… or will you let it consume you?"

Gameplay begins with the player alone in the slums—legacy yet unwritten.
