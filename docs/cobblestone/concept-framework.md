> "From the streets, a legacy rises."

Cobblestone Legacy is a sandbox RPG with rogue-lite elements set inside a living, procedurally generated Victorian city. You begin as a 12-year-old orphan and must survive, grow, and ultimately shape the fate of Grimborough through the choices you make, the factions you court, and the risks you take.

## Core Pillars

### Survival Mechanics
- Track stamina, energy, thirst, and hunger to stay alive in a harsh city with limited resources.
- Rest, sleep, forage, or tinker to recover vital stats and discover new opportunities.

### Exploration & Discovery
- Fog of war obscures the city and encourages scouting.
- Discover stashes, hideouts, and key locations through rumors, tracking NPCs, and exploration.
- Every run is unique thanks to procedural city generation.

### Player Progression
- Train skills such as stealth, lockpicking, crafting, and combat.
- Earn experience through quests, activities, and training.
- Unlock impactful capstone abilities when maxing a skill.

### Faction Dynamics
- Ally with, sabotage, or betray competing factions.
- Reputation and infamy shape access to resources, perks, and quests.
- A reactive city economy and politics respond to player actions.

### Narrative Depth
- Dialogue choices, quests, and random events weave a personal narrative.
- NPCs remember past actions, share rumors, and expose the history of Grimborough.
- Decide whether to help clean up the city or let it descend into chaos.
