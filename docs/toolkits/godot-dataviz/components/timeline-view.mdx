Track-based bars with configurable tick scales, auto label clipping, and an optional "now" marker. Great for schedules, incidents, or quest timelines.

## Data binding

- `set_tick_range(start: float, end: float)`
- `add_track(name: String)`
- `add_event(track: String, label: String, t0: float, t1: float, color := Color)`

## Perfect for

- Incident or quest tracking.
