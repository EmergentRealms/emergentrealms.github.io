> **Tagline:** Your command surface.

A lightweight toolbar that matches Godot's look and hooks into the same builder API as FilterBar. Ideal for primary commands or view mode switches.

## Data binding

- `add_button`, `add_toggle`, `add_menu`, `add_option`, `add_input`, `add_separator`, `add_spacer`
- Listen for the shared `action(id, payload)` signal.

## Example usage

```gdscript
# TODO: Provide a ToolBar usage example.
# Demonstrate button icons, toggles, and payload handling.
```

## Why it's great

- Shares API and styling cues with FilterBar for consistency.
- Icon, tooltip, and toggle states out of the box.
- Lightweight footprint for editor or runtime UIs.

## Perfect for

- Top-level app controls.
- View mode or layout toggles.
- Command strips in tooling or overlays.
