# Cobblestone Legacy

**Tagline:** From the streets, a legacy rises.

Cobblestone Legacy is a sandbox RPG with rogue-lite elements set in a dynamic, procedurally generated industrial city. You begin as a 12-year-old orphan struggling to survive in a world of scarcity, simmering faction rivalries, and dangerous opportunity. Every choice the player makes ripples through the city’s economy, factions, and unfolding narrative, ensuring no two runs are alike.

## Snapshot

- **Engine:** Godot 4.4 (Jolt) + C++ GDExtension, SQLite
- **Session Length:** 3–6 hour runs with unlockable traits, skills, and equipment
- **Core Pillars:** Survival, Heist/Stealth, Faction Influence, Dynamic Narrative
- **Playstyle Promise:** Explore freely, improvise daring scores, and rise from orphan to legend.
