Cobblestone Legacy blends survival, exploration, and player-driven storytelling inside a living, procedurally generated city. These pillars guide every system we build.

## Survival Mechanics

- **Vital Need Management:** Track stamina, energy, thirst, hunger, and rest. Neglecting needs triggers penalties, debuffs, and even death timers.
- **Urban Foraging:** Scavenge alleys, forage in hidden gardens, or barter for supplies to keep vital stats topped up.
- **Rest & Recovery:** Safehouses allow sleeping, passive observation for experience, or tinkering to raise crafting skills.

## Exploration & Discovery

- **Fog of War:** The city map begins obscured. Push into unknown districts to reveal stashes, hideouts, and fast-travel routes.
- **Rumor-Driven Leads:** NPC whispers expose new points of interest, secret caches, and score opportunities.
- **Procedural Layouts:** Each run rebuilds district layouts, encounter nodes, and traversal challenges to keep exploration fresh.

## Player Progression

- **Trainable Skill Web:** Level stealth, lockpicking, crafting, combat, and more through use, training, and faction tutoring.
- **Synergy Bonuses:** Related skills feed into each other, offering small mechanical boosts that reward specialization.
- **Capstone Abilities:** Max-level skills unlock signature moves and perks that redefine playstyles.

## Faction Dynamics

- **Choice-Driven Alliances:** Aid or sabotage gangs, merchants, and guards to earn reputation, infamy, and unique perks.
- **Reactive World State:** Factions claim territory, escalate conflicts, or grant safe passage based on your actions.
- **Betrayal or Loyalty:** Switching sides mid-run has lasting repercussions, altering quest lines and market access.

## Narrative Depth

- **Meaningful Decisions:** Story arcs and quest outcomes branch on morality, loyalty, and survival choices.
- **Characterful NPCs:** Learn the city’s history, secrets, and personal struggles through dialog, observation, and rumor chasing.
- **Multiple Endgames:** Pursue power, wealth, reform, or infamy to shape the city’s future.

## Signature Activities

- Track routines to plan heists, stake out wealthy homes, or intercept guarded caravans.
- Pickpocket targets, infiltrate buildings, craft bespoke tools, and trade contraband through black-market contacts.
- Escape guards using parkour routes, underground sewers, and safehouse networks.
