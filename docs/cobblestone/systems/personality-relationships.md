## Personality-Driven NPCs

These traits are evaluated inside multithreaded C++ workers so the system scales to thousands of citizens without compromising responsiveness.

- Every NPC is generated with a unique Big Five personality profile that governs openness, agreeableness, extraversion, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.
- Personalities influence trust, affinity growth, decision making, and even greeting style.
- No two characters behave the same, ensuring emergent, memorable interactions.

## Relationship Manager

- Tracks affinity and trust for every player–NPC connection and NPC–NPC pairing.
- Relationships grow organically through repeated positive encounters or decay when neglected.
- Trait compatibility modifies relationship gains, making some bonds effortless and others fraught.
- Rumors and shared history color how NPCs perceive the player before the next conversation even begins.

## Dialog Integration

- Greetings, prompts, and branching options adapt to affinity, trust, and personality data.
- Conversations can recruit allies, unlock quests, resolve conflicts, or escalate rivalries.
- Player-driven persona choices feed back into how the world responds, allowing roleplay to matter mechanically.

## Role-Playing Potential

- Define your own personality through actions, shaping how NPCs approach you.
- Use social systems for diplomacy, espionage, performance, or manipulation.
- Experience emergent storylines as personalities clash, align, or slowly evolve together.
