## Coastal Layout

- Winding shoreline with sandy beaches, rocky cliffs, and a bustling harbor.
- Islands and outcroppings dot the bay; a lighthouse crowns a storm-battered cliff.

## District Breakdown

### Slums
Tight, chaotic alleys filled with shanties, hideouts, and covert meeting spots.

### Market District
An open-air bazaar of stalls, guild halls, and bustling foot traffic.

### Industrial Zone
Factories, warehouses, and smoke stacks belching across the skyline.

### Residential & Noble Quarters
Packed townhomes, manicured estates, gardens, and private guards.

### Docks
Shipyards, taverns, cranes, and storehouses lining the harbor.

## Points of Interest

- Central church with towering spires and a shadowed graveyard.
- Guardhouse anchoring the city gate and chokepoints.
- Gang hideouts hidden in factories and tunnels.
- Dilapidated orphanage deep in the slums.
- Merchant Guild Hall watching over the market.
- Library or Scholar’s Hall tucked inside the noble quarter.
- Signature taverns that act as social and quest hubs.
- Sewer access points, hidden stashes, and secret routes.

## Routes & Terrain

- Cobblestone main streets connect districts; dirt paths thread the outskirts.
- Forested hills, farmland, and a river frame the city.
- Windmills turn along the ridge beyond the walls.
- Harbor scenes feature moored ships, skiffs, and ferries.

## Style Notes

- Hand-drawn map with parchment tones, decorative borders, and illustrated icons.
- Labels use thematic typography with icons (cross for church, anchor for harbor, etc.).
- Include a compass rose, sea monsters, and sailing ships to reinforce the era.
