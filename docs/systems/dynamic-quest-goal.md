Quests in Cobblestone Legacy are not static checklists. The Dynamic Quest & Goal System generates objectives from NPC motivations, faction agendas, and the ambitions you set for yourself.

## Intent-Driven Progression

- **Player Intents:** Define high-level ambitions such as *Become a master thief*, *Reclaim Grimborough’s streets*, or *Start a black-market empire*. The system responds with structured sub-quests tailored to your chosen path.
- **NPC Personalities:** Quests respect each questgiver’s personality, trust level, and risk tolerance. A paranoid noble will never offer espionage work to an unproven orphan, while a desperate merchant might bankroll smuggling jobs.
- **Dynamic Dependencies:** Success, failure, or abandonment reshapes future opportunities. Burning a contact can close a quest chain—or open a darker alternative.

## Quest Generation Inputs

| Input | Influence |
| --- | --- |
| **Faction State** | Territorial control, conflicts, and alliances determine mission availability. |
| **Rumor Network** | Gossip reveals leads, marks, and time-sensitive opportunities. |
| **Economy Signals** | Price spikes create procurement jobs; shortages trigger smuggling or sabotage missions. |
| **Player Skills** | Skill proficiencies unlock specialized tasks (e.g., master lockpick jobs). |

## Quest & Activity Examples

1. **Find Medicine for a Wounded NPC:** Secure supplies through trade, theft, or crafting for loyalty and intel.
2. **Deliver a Secret Package:** Navigate hostile districts to smuggle contraband unseen.
3. **Spy on a Rival Faction:** Gather intelligence to swing an upcoming power struggle.
4. **Stakeout a Wealthy Home:** Learn routines before orchestrating a high-stakes heist.
5. **Rescue a Kidnapped Ally:** Storm a rival hideout or negotiate their release.
6. **Sabotage Security:** Disable alarms, traps, or patrol routes to prep a future job.
7. **Reclaim Confiscated Items:** Break into guard barracks to retrieve seized gear.
8. **Recruit Allies:** Persuade specialists to join your operation with the right leverage.
9. **Protect a Caravan:** Escort goods through dangerous territory to earn faction favor.
10. **Craft Rare Items:** Fulfill bespoke orders for wealth, reputation, or unique blueprints.

## Activity Loop Support

Beyond formal quests, players engage in a variety of supporting activities:

- Pickpocketing, scavenging, and trading to stay afloat.
- Training stealth, crafting, acrobatics, and more to meet mission prerequisites.
- Following wealthy NPCs, staking out targets, and breaking into buildings for resources.
- Escaping guards via parkour, sewer routes, or improvised hideouts.

## Endgame Destinies

Your cumulative decisions unlock bespoke finale scenarios:

- **Faction Leadership:** Command a faction and reshape city policy.
- **Master Thief:** Become a legendary score-runner feared by all.
- **City Reformer:** Clean up Grimborough and inspire civic renewal.
- **Wealth & Influence:** Build an above-board empire—or an underground syndicate.

The quest system is the connective tissue between survival mechanics, social intrigue, and the city’s evolving economy. Learn how those economic levers work in the [Economy & Crafting Loop](/docs/systems/economy-crafting).
