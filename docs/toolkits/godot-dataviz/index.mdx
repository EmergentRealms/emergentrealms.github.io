> **Tagline:** Production-ready charts, tables, tiles, and graph widgets for data-driven Godot games and tools.

A reusable UI toolkit for Godot 4 that ships with polished, data-agnostic controls: BarChartView, LineChartView, HistogramView, SparklineTile, KpiTile, HeatMapView, BoxPlotView, TimelineView, VirtualTableView, FilterBar, ToolBar, DetailPanel, WaterfallView, RelationshipGraphView, and helper EntityCard nodes. Every control is theme-aware, emits hover/click signals, and plays nicely with both GDScript and C++.
