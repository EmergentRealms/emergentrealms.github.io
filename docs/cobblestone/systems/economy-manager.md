## A Living, Breathing Economy

The world of **Cobblestone Legacy** operates without invisible hands or abstract market rules.  
Every coin that changes hands, every shipment that arrives or fails to, every shop that burns down or thrives — all of it is simulated in real time through the actions of players and NPCs.

There are **no global systems** silently adjusting prices or balancing markets.  
Instead, the economy emerges naturally from individual decisions, risks, and events.

## Player and NPC Actions Define Everything

Merchants buy, sell, and store goods just like real participants in a living city.  
When demand rises, prices rise. When a supply route is disrupted, shortages form. When someone floods the market with stolen goods, value collapses.

- **Prosperity through success:** A merchant who makes wise trades and maintains good relationships will see their wealth and influence grow.  
- **Loss through consequence:** If their shop is robbed or burned, they must pay to rebuild.  
- **Risk through theft and conflict:** If a caravan is intercepted, the merchant loses the goods and others in the city feel the ripple effects.

Every transaction—honest or criminal—echoes through the web of relationships that make up the city’s economy.

## Cause and Effect at Every Level

This system ensures that **every outcome is earned**, not scripted:

- Prices shift based on **real availability** of goods, not arbitrary algorithms.  
- NPCs react dynamically to changing conditions—seeking safer trade routes, raising prices, or abandoning unprofitable trades.  
- Factions rise and fall based on the success of their economic ventures.  
- Players can manipulate the system for profit, stability, or chaos.

There are no resets or global recalculations—only consequences.

## Emergent Gameplay

Because everything is simulated, the economy becomes a powerful storytelling engine:

- A **fire in a warehouse** can create a city-wide shortage of food or textiles.  
- A **bandit raid** on a trade convoy might crash the local iron market.  
- A **noble’s festival** could temporarily boost demand for luxury goods.  
- A **player’s intervention**—through trade, theft, or sabotage—can permanently alter the flow of commerce.

Every coin and resource has a history. Every price reflects the world’s state.  
It’s not just an economy—it’s the heartbeat of a living simulation.

**In Cobblestone Legacy, wealth is earned, risk is real, and every decision leaves a mark on the world.**
