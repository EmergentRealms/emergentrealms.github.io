                Autoload node that stores and distributes the active DVTheme to all components.
        </brief_description>
        <description>
                DVThemeManager acts as the central theme registry for the addon. Add it as an autoload to your project to
                make [method get_singleton] available from anywhere. Components connect to the manager to be notified when
                [member active_theme] changes, allowing you to switch dashboards between light and dark modes instantly.

                The manager can also load a default theme from disk at startup by configuring
                [member default_theme_path], making it easy to ship curated style presets with your addon.
