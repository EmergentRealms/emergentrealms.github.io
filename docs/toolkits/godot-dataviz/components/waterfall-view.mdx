> **Tagline:** How you got from A → B.

Visualize cumulative deltas leading to a final total. Automatically computes running sums, color-codes ups/downs, and labels every step.

## Data binding

- `set_steps(steps: Array)` where each step is `{ label, delta }`
- `set_base_value(value: float)` for the starting total.

- Automatic running total calculation and labeling.
- Color coding for increases, decreases, and totals.
- Ideal for showing contributions to a final outcome.

## Perfect for

- Economy delta breakdowns.
- Budget or scoring recaps.
- Post-mortem analyses in tools or dashboards.
