I’m hard at work re-factoring the entire game world in C++ with GDExtension. This overhaul isn’t just about cleaner architecture—it’s about unlocking the performance and flexibility the project needs to truly come alive. I’m especially looking forward to rebuilding the world on top of this new foundation and seeing my kids dive back in, testing the new systems firsthand and experiencing the performance gains for themselves.  

I’m still a couple of months away from internal family playtests, but the progress has me hopeful for the project’s future. The idea of sitting back and watching my kids plot heists, trade supplies, and laugh their way through emergent chaos on the new systems keeps me motivated through the long refactor sessions.  

In parallel with development, I also took a big step on the business side of things: last week I officially founded **Emergent Realms Incorporated**. That meant handling everything from registering for tax status to opening bank accounts and filing the paperwork that will support *Cobblestone Legacy* as it grows. At this point, I’m just waiting on a couple of final documents before creating the Steam Workshop page. It’s surreal to see this project grow from a family hobby into something with a real company standing behind it.

## Visualizing the Invisible

Developer tools became unsung heroes. Live overlays for perception, thread load, and NPC intent kept complex systems understandable. Debug panels often doubled as teaching moments—my kids learned to read charts showing hunger levels city-wide or faction sway over time.  

Lesson learned: invest in introspection. Good telemetry shortens debugging cycles and sparks fresh design ideas. Some of those overlays may even evolve into in-universe gadgets for players.  

## Personal Reflections & The Road Ahead

This project began as a gift for my children. It evolved into a crash course in multiplayer networking, modern C++, AI design, and data-driven worldbuilding. Along the way, we built more than a game—we built memories.  

Looking forward, we’re exploring broader playtests, expanded regions beyond the city walls, and deeper progression arcs. Whatever comes next, the heart of *Cobblestone Legacy* remains unchanged: a family-driven adventure crafted cobblestone by cobblestone.  

Thanks for reading, cheering, and sharing the journey. Here’s to the stories still to come. 🎮❤️
