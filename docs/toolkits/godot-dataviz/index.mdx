The **Godot DataViz UI Kit** is a polished, performance-oriented visualization suite built for developers who need clear, reactive data interfaces inside their Godot projects.  
Originally engineered for *Cobblestone Legacy*—a large-scale simulation game running thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of SQLite datapoints—this kit now brings those same world-class tools to your own dashboards, editors, and player UIs.

## Built for developers who think in data

Modern simulation and management games depend on *information clarity*. When you’re tracking economies, relationships, production chains, or runtime metrics, raw tables aren’t enough—you need fast, expressive visuals that can live directly in your Godot scenes or editor tools.

The **DataViz UI Kit** gives you:

- **Drop-in components** for charts, gauges, tables, and heatmaps  
- **Automatic theming** via a centralized color seed system  
- **Signal-driven interactivity** (hover, click, select)  
- **Canvas-optimized performance** for large datasets  
- **Full editor + code access**, ideal for both dev dashboards and runtime UIs

## Central Theme & Color System

Every control in the kit connects to a single **Theme Resource**.  
Changing a few color seeds—Primary, Success, Warning, Error, Info—automatically recolors every chart, axis, and label.  
Switch between **Light** and **Dark** mode instantly, or let your players customize their own UI palette at runtime.

This makes it perfect for teams who value both **consistency and accessibility** across multiple views, or want their analytics overlays to feel truly integrated with the game’s art direction.

---

## Designed for scalability

Whether you’re monitoring simulation stats or visualizing combat logs, these controls handle:
- **Thousands of datapoints** from Godot DataStructs or SQLite or JSON sources  
- **Real-time updates** with minimal redraw overhead  
- **Virtualized tables** for massive datasets  
- **Optimized C++ rendering paths** via GDExtension  

Because every component accepts plain arrays you can connect them to *any* data source—without rewriting your data model.
