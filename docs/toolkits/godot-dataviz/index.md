# Godot DataViz UI Kit

The Godot DataViz UI Kit is a collection of reusable visualization controls that share a unified theme system. Each component is documented with editable properties, integration notes, and runnable GDScript snippets so you can drop them straight into dashboards, editors, and gameplay overlays.

## What's inside

- **Charts:** Multi-series bar and line charts, box plots, waterfalls, and timelines for showing change over time.
- **Graphs:** Gauges, KPI tiles, pie charts, and radar graphs for quick-glance metrics.
- **Other UI:** Virtualized tables, heat maps, and detail panels for deeper inspection.

Browse the individual pages below to see screenshots, API highlights, and tutorials for each control.

> Need theme guidance? Start with the [Central Theme Manager](./central-theme.md) to configure color seeds and light/dark modes for the entire toolkit.
